- Have the "Let's Begin!" button kick off the game - DONE!

- Make sure that the computer's move is echoed / displayed by the game board buttons

- Provide functionality to the 'player' buttons

- I'll need a while loop for the computer choices

- Have the game abruptly restart after a wrong answer? OR, Have the bottons flash RED! Like, all 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 to denote 'lives / chances'!
